Andrew Reeves is the director of the [Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](http://wc.wustl.edu) and professor of [political science](http://polisci.wustl.edu) at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://www.wustl.edu). He is also a Visiting Fellow at the [Hoover Institution](https://www.hoover.org) and an associate of the [Taylor Geospatial Institute](https://taylorgeospatial.org/). At WashU, he is an affiliate ofthe [Center for the Environment](https://environment.wustl.edu/), the [Division of Computational and Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu), and the [Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity & Equity](https://cre2.wustl.edu/). He has previously held research fellowships at the [Hoover Institution](https://www.hoover.org) at [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu) and at the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu) at [Yale University](https://yale.edu).

His research investigates the intersections of American political institutions, electoral behavior, and public policy, particularly emphasizing the presidency and executive politics. He examines how political accountability and institutional design shape governance and policy outcomes, making significant contributions to understanding presidential power, voter behavior, and the urban-rural divide. Reeves' work demonstrates that modern presidencies often prioritize partisan and electoral interests, challenges the notion of public passivity toward executive power, and explores the factors driving political polarization. His research agenda focuses on governmental responses and public opinion toward climate crises and local governance, examining how local contexts and institutions influence public policy and democratic representation.

His most recent book, [_No Blank Check: The Origins and Consequences of Public Antipathy towards Presidential Power_](https://andrewreeves.org/research/no-blank-check-the-origins-and-consequences-of-public-antipathy-towards-presidential-power/) with [Jon C. Rogowski](https://voices.uchicago.edu/jrogowski/) was published in 2022 with Cambridge University Press ( [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Check-Consequences-Antipathy-Presidential/dp/1107174309/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1646002322&refinements=p_27%3AJon+C.+Rogowski&s=books&sr=1-2) | [CUP](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/no-blank-check/0FE4E2FC0D017DC70566FDFE94B89007)). His first book, [_The Particularistic President: Executive Branch Politics and Political Inequality_](https://andrewreeves.org/research/the-particularistic-president-executive-branch-politics-and-political-inequality/) with [Douglas Kriner](http://blogs.cornell.edu/kriner/) is the winner of the 2016 Richard E. Neustadt Award ( [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Douglas-L-Kriner/dp/1107616816/) | [CUP](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/particularistic-president/1C2686B436BCBFAB3D46EDBD7C2A17C3)).
